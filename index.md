## News:

### 28Feb2019:
Just started with my homepage project. Nothing too interesting going on here but the project will live on.

## Hello World!

Here's a short **Hello World!** program written in [Python3](https://www.python.org/) for your enjoyment! ```:snake:```

```python3

print('Hello World!')

``` 

### Afterwords

Was that it?!? Yes it was! Everything is runtime code in Python. Isn't it wonderful?!? ```:raised_hands:```
No wonder it has become my current favourite programming language. Very beginner friendly and easy to learn but still a powerfull tool if you master it! ```:godmode:```

*Keeping the next lines here as an cheat sheet for myself:*

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jonbenronron/jonbenronron.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
